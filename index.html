                    <p class="box">
                        For a class project, I worked in a group of three people in order to analyze and redesign the RIT housing and dining website, so that students could have an better experience applying for housing and dining plans, as well as make improvements to other areas of the website,
                        including maintenance requests, login, and navigation. We created lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes on Figma and conducted user testing on RIT students.

                        My group, which included three other members, and I created a prototype of a mobile app using Figma in a week for Rochester Childfirst Network (RCN) that improved the process of student pick-up and drop-off for both parents and workers at RCN as a part of the 2022 UX Studio Design group competition at RIT.
                        Our group presented the process and design to representatives from RCN and won the competition.

                    <p class="box"> 
                        I participated in a UX Studio Design competition at RIT, where we were challenged to redesign a charity's website.
                        The organization, Water for South Sudan (WFSS), presented their current website, as well as the problems with the design of their current website.
                        I worked with two other people to develop a <span class="bold">prototype</span> for our redesign using <span class="bold">Figma</span>. We conducted <span class="bold">user testing</span>
                        to improve our design. Once we finished our prototype, we presented our design to a panel of judges. While we did not win the competition, our design received an
                        <span class="bold">honorable mention</span> for our design and user testing.
