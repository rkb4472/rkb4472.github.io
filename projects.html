                        I was involved in a competition at RIT, where we were challenged to redesign a charity's website and create a prototype of our new design. 
                        The organization, Water for South Sudan (WFSS), presented their current website, as well as the problems they had with the design of their current website.
                    </p>
                <div class="part">
                        <p class="num2">1</p>
                        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Water for South Sudan is a charity organization that is dedicated to providing clean water and other services, such as well rehabilitation and hygiene education, to South Sudan. Their website is used both for American donors to donate to the 
                    cause and for people who live in South Sudan to request services from WFSS. 
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    The problem WFSS found with their website is that it was confusing for these two distinct audiences
                    to find the correct part of the website that they needed.
                    
                </p>
                <div class="part">
                    <p class="num2">2</p>
                    <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We were given a week to create a new design and then present it to representatives from the charity. 
                    We started by thinking about the audience of the website and brainstorming different ideas for how to redesign the website and tackle
                    the problem that the original website had.
                    Then, we began by making different sketches to visualize the ideas we had for the redesign of the website.
                </p>
                <p class="sketches">
                    Some Sketch Examples:
                </p>
                <div class="sketchPics">
                    <img class="sketch" src="sketch12.jpg" alt="logo" width="450">
                    <img class="sketch" src="popupsketch2.jpg" alt="logo" width="344">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Utimately, our group decided to use a pop-up that would appear when a user first visits the site. This pop-up would ask the user why they were visiting the site and based on their choice, it would
                    redirect them to the correct website (American site for donors, South Sudan website for others).
                </p>
                <h3 class="bold">Next Steps:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We made more sketches for the website, including what the homepage would look like and what the page for requesting services from WFSS would look like. We also finalized our popup sketch design, which 
                        ultimately was a combination of all of our groups' original ideas and sketches. We decided the popup should take up the entire page when a user first gets on the website, instead of having of having the 
                        popup be on top of the website, which was another possibility that we were thinking about. Ultimately, we chose it taking up the whole page because it was important to redirect people to the correct page and did
                        not want people to ignore the popup or be confused about whether they actually needed to answer the question or not.
                    </li>
                    <li>After we had completed our sketches and made our final decisions on the popup and the home page and services page, we created a wireframe of our ideas utilizing figma.
                        We took some of the pictures and sections from their original website, but reorganized and redesigned it.
                    </li>
                    <li>The last part of our design process was turning the wireframe in a prototype. We added links from the popup to the correct pages and also the links that would lead to
                        the Services page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once we completed our prototype, we were able to move into one of the last steps in our design process, which was user testing. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="bold">User Testing:</h3>
                <div class="test1">
                    <p class="bold">Description of User Testing</p>
                    <p>In order to test our prototype, we found five participants to use our prototype. We made five different scenarios and asked our participants to pretend they were a certain part of the audience that would use this website (for example a donor).
                        Next, we presented our prototype to the participant and see if they clicked on the correct link and were brought to the correct website. We also tested to see if users could find their way from the homepage to the Services page (where users
                        could request services from WFSS). Our scenarios and results are summed up in this document: <a href="userTesting.pdf">User Testing</a></p>
                </div> 
                <div class="test1">
                    <p class="bold">Findings From User Testing</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>One participant explained that they did not read two of the buttons on the pop-up because they were too confusing.</li>
                        <li>Another participant explained that the pop-up was quick and easy for them to use.</li>
                        <li>As we observed participants using the website, we noticed that the path to the Services page was confusing and misleading.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
                </div> 
                <div class="test1">
                    <p class="bold">Conclusions From User Testing & Changes Made</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The popup questions did work and having the popup ask the users about the goal was able to direct people to the correct site.</li>
                        <li>The wording of the questions on the popup were important. They had to be simple so that people could quickly and easily read it, but still detailed enough to still direct people to the correct place. </li>

                        <li>Having more links between pages was helpful for users to navigate to the desired page, and helped to make the path to the Services page less confusing.</li>

                <p>    
                    Ultimately,
                    we did not end up winning the competition, and the organization chose another group's design over ours. But our group did receive an honorable mention, as they were impressed with our design, 
                    as well as our user testing.

                    <li>Time management and planning were important for completing the prototype in time, as we only had a week to finish it. We stayed on track by creating a schedule
                        and dividing up tasks between members</li>
                    <li>Communication between team members about our ideas and plans was critical to the success of our project. We would meet everyday over zoom to discuss what we had finished so far, brainstorm more ideas together, and plan our next meeting. </li>
                    <li>The winning design combined the two websites into one, which might be simpler than our design, but still easily
                        direct people to the correct information.

                <h2>UNIX Website (Wireframes)</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="unix">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                For a group project in my web and mobile class we created a website to introduce others to the basics of UNIX.</p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>In my group, I designed the layout of the website and created wireframes for our website
                in figma: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/4DP1jCYD8VAadYCJM7YzQp/W-and-M-Group-Project-UNIX-Survival-Guide?node-id=0%3A1">Unix Website Wireframes</a>.
                I also wrote some of the UNIX content for our website (unit 2) and helped to build the website at the end of the project, mostly working on the CSS.
                </p>
                <figure>
                <img style="padding-top:1em;" class="unixpic" src="unixdesktopwf.jpg" alt="logo" width="700">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center;padding-top:1em;padding-bottom:1.5em;">Desktop wireframe for homepage</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    This is the wireframe for the landing/home page, which introduces the audience to the website and how to use the website. The information is divided into different paragraphs with proper headings. 
                    The navigation for desktop size screes will be located on the left, so that it can be easily found and used. It clearly lays out how the information will be organized so that users can see the clear path of 
                    lessons that they will go through. If users are already semi-knowledgeable on UNIX, they can skip to a unit or section that they still need to learn. If there are users who are just beginning to learn UNIX using our website, they can start at the beginning 
                    and go step by step through all of the information and quizzes. Users can also navigate to the lessons using the Start Unit One -> button on the upper right side of the screen.
                </p>
                <figure>
                <img style="padding-top:1.5em;" class="unixpic" src="unixmobilewf.jpg" alt="logo" width="700">
                <figcaption style="text-align:center;padding-top:1em;padding-bottom:1.5em;">Mobile wireframe</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The mobile has a similar layout and navigation as the desktop screen, but with a few changes to accommodate the smaller screen. The navigation is hidden at first, but is found by using the hamburger button. 
                    The logo and title is smaller to fit on top of the screen. It includes the same information and headings as the desktop screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made additional wireframes for a content page and a quiz page (as well as corresponding mobile ones).        
                    The desktop view for each lesson/content page has the same navigation and header section in order to have consistency between the different sections. The content part has a similar layout across different sections/lessons, but will be somewhat 
                    different based on the pictures/text needed for that particular lesson. Also, there will be a next section button and a previous section button at the end of the page after all the content. The quiz page has the heading in the same location as the other 
                    pages, and follow a similar layout as other sections, except with questions and answers as the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code for the finished website can be found in github: <a href="https://github.com/rkb4472/UNIX-Website.git">UNIX Website</a>.

                        JavaScript was used in order to create an image gallery for the PARKS page of my website. Different images of the park called Thacher Park were originally displayed on my website using grid/css and were next to each other. But in order to add more user 
                        interaction to my website and display these images in a more interesting way, I changed the way the images were displayed by utilizing JavaScript. One bigger image is displayed and the other images are displayed below it and are displayed smaller.
                         When users click on the smaller images, they fade in and replace the larger image.

                            When users first reach my website, they are directed to a login page. They register by making a username and password (entering the password twice and it must be the same). Usernames and passwords are stored in the database and so when someone goes to login, the username and 
                            password is checked to see if the username and password has already been registered and is in the database.
